eventually settling on PHP for web development. I have use different RDBMS like Informix, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, and
different OS, although usually *nix based."
- "I write clean and clear code, following coding standards, design patterns, and DRY and SOLID principles.
I consider testing a first-class aspect of development, rather than an after-thought. Which is why I appreciate TDD
and BDD and I regularly write unit and integration tests, as well as end-to-end tests."
- "Although my framework of choice is Laravel, which I have been using personally and professionally since version 4.2,
I believe myself to be a framework-agnostic developer, and able to work with Symfony or any other modern framework."
- "I have been part of many cross-functional teams, and worked along, and together, with frontend developers,
designers, UI and UX experts, and QA engineers. I am verse in Agile and acknowledge its advantages and flaws."
- "I like mentoring developers. I have had the opportunity to be able to advice and guide developers, and I found
myself naturally becoming a point of reference for them. I find helping someone becoming a better developer very
gratifying."
