Hello everyone and thank you for visiting my site.

My name is Giulio, I am a Britalian living in London (for now). I am a software developer by trade and a husband by choice.

Nowadays, I work with PHP and Laravel, although I did tip my toes in a few other languages. And my site is mostly about 
that. I do have plans to write about other things, but I seem to never find the time.

I have a passion for clean, tested and testable code, proper grammar, and baking. Not at the same time though.

I was lucky enough to be amongst the 1,000 drummers known as [Pandemonium Drummers](https://www.pandemoniumdrummers.co.uk/p/about.html)
and I performed in front of a 60,000 strong live audience and, I don't know, 2 billion people around the world? I still
get goosebumps when I hear the music for our segment.

I am a 1st-dan black belt in judo, so be careful in your comments. Jokes aside, I really enjoyed judo. It taught me
a lot about myself and how to live a better life in this world. I am so grateful to Judo that in fact my very first 
tattoo was the two Kanji for Ju-Do.

Oh yes, that was just the first. I had two more done after that: on to celebrate my Olympic experience, and one to
celebrate my marriage. And more recently I had a sleeve done by an amazing artist: [Volkan Demirci](https://www.instagram.com/volkantattooz)

I loved travelling, still do actually, and I was lucky enough that my husband and I were able to go to so many amazing places before
I decided to stop flying. No, not for environmental reasons. I just get very anxious even just thinking about flying.
And I have discovered that so many people are in the same boat (pun intended) as me. Some are able to get over it and
keep flying. Others, like me, are not. And it's ok. We'll be fine. It's just another opportunity to see more of the UK.

Once again, thanks for checking out my site.
