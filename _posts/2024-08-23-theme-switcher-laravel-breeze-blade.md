I had a long, very long, standing personal project (who doesn't, hey?) that was in desperate need
of attention. It was running on a old version of Laravel, it was using a very old-fashioned look-and-feel,
a mix of Vue and Blade, some unit test, some Dusk, but not for everything. It was a bit of a mess, so I decided,
like many other in my shoes, to start from scratch.

Obviously I am using Laravel, and because there will be same authentication and authorisation I chose to use
Laravel Breeze. If you don't know what it is, this is what the [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze) says
> Laravel Breeze is a minimal, simple implementation of all of Laravel's authentication features, including login,
> registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation.

I follow the instruction on how to install it and chose the Blade scaffolding with Livewire and Class-based Volt.
Most importantly I opted to support dark mode. 

That simply meant that all the template and components have been styled for both light and dark mode, using Tailwind CSS.

What I did find puzzling was that there was no way to switch between themes. Sure, I could have added the `dark` class
to the `<body>`, but that isn't what I was expecting. Since everything is already styled to support both themes, why
isn't there a way **for the user** to change between light and dark mode?

This article is not about answering that question, that would be up to the Laravel Breeze's maintainers.
This article is about how I implemented a theme switcher that work with the scaffolded app.

Spoiler alert, it's not all my original work.

I noticed that Laravel itself already comes with a theme switcher. If you get an error or an exception, Laravel displays
something like the following:

![Screenshot of how Laravel renders an error or exception](assets/img/theme-switcher-laravel-breeze-blade/laravel-exception-screen-light.png){: .light }
![Screenshot of how Laravel renders an error or exception](assets/img/theme-switcher-laravel-breeze-blade/laravel-exception-screen-dark.png){: .dark }

Did you notice the little sun icon (or moon icon if you're using dark mode) in the top-right corner? That's the Laravel's
theme switcher. That's a good start, I can leverage it and adapt it to my case.

Although that was a good starting point, I didn't feel it really worked well with the Breeze UI. I have to point out
again that I chose the Blade and Livewire UI, so for Vue or React things may look different. What I did take from the
Laravel theme switcher was the idea to store the user's choice in the browser local storage.

This is how the theme switcher works:
- when the user chooses the dark theme, this choice is stored in the local storage and a class `dark` is added to the whole
document
- when the user chooses the light theme, this choice is again stored in the local storage, but this time the `dark` class
is removed from the document
- when the user chooses the system settings, then the local storage is deleted and the `dark` class is added if the
system theme is "dark"
- finally, an event listener is set to watch out for changes in the system theme

Once that was done the rest was just a matter of UI. I chose to have a dropdown when the screen was big enough, or
a series of three buttons for mobile screens.

Now, finally, let's see some code. I have also created a GitHub 
[Gist](https://gist.github.com/troccoli/f5b46db807faa05abeb5c25a1cc648a1)
you can use.

```js
export const ThemeSwitcher = {
  setDarkClass: () => {
    let isDark = localStorage.theme === 'dark' ||
      (!('theme' in localStorage) &&
        window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches)

    isDark
      ? document.documentElement.classList.add('dark')
      : document.documentElement.classList.remove('dark')
  },

  init: () => {
    ThemeSwitcher.setDarkClass()
    window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').addEventListener('change', ThemeSwitcher.setDarkClass)
    window.ThemeSwitcher = ThemeSwitcher
  }
}
```
{: file="resources/js/theme-switcher.js" }

```js
import './bootstrap';
import {ThemeSwitcher} from './theme-switcher';

ThemeSwitcher.init()
```
{: file="resources/js/app.js" }

The next changes are in `resources/views/livewire/layout/navigation.blade.php`{: .filepath } but it would be too awkward to paste the
whole file so I am going to show what to change. The whole file can be downloaded 
[here](https://gist.github.com/troccoli/f5b46db807faa05abeb5c25a1cc648a1#file-navigation-blade-php).

First of all you need to set some initial state, so add the following to the `x-data` attribute of the `nav` element,
```js
theme: localStorage.theme,
darkMode() {
    this.theme = 'dark'
    localStorage.theme = 'dark'
    ThemeSwitcher.setDarkClass()
},
lightMode() {
    this.theme = 'light'
    localStorage.theme = 'light'
    ThemeSwitcher.setDarkClass()
},
systemMode() {
    this.theme = undefined
    localStorage.removeItem('theme')
    ThemeSwitcher.setDarkClass()
},
```

Then we need to add the switcher on the page itself. I have decided to put it next to the profile, i.e. the user's
email. So, add the following in the "Settings dropdown" section, just inside the outer `div`:
```html
<div class="hidden sm:block">
    <x-dropdown width="w-28 mt-4">
        <x-slot name="trigger">
            <x-heroicon-s-sun class="w-5 h-5 block text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-700 dark:hidden"/>
            <x-heroicon-s-moon class="w-5 h-5 hidden dark:block dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:text-gray-300"/>
        </x-slot>
        <x-slot name="content">
            <button class="flex w-full items-center gap-3 px-3 py-2 text-start text-sm leading-5 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 focus:outline-none focus:bg-gray-100 dark:focus:bg-gray-800 transition duration-150 ease-in-out"
                    :class="theme === 'light' ? 'text-gray-900 font-medium' : 'text-gray-700 font-normal dark:text-gray-400 dark:font-normal'"
                    @click="lightMode()"
            >
                <x-heroicon-o-sun class="w-5 h-5" ::class="theme === 'light' ? 'hidden' : 'block'"/>
                <x-heroicon-s-sun class="w-5 h-5" ::class="theme === 'light' ? 'block' : 'hidden'"/>
                {{ __('Light') }}
            </button>
            <button class="flex w-full items-center gap-3 px-3 py-2 text-start text-sm leading-5 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 focus:outline-none focus:bg-gray-100 dark:focus:bg-gray-800 transition duration-150 ease-in-out"
                    :class="theme === 'dark' ? 'dark:text-gray-100 dark:font-medium' : 'text-gray-700 font-normal dark:text-gray-400 dark:font-normal'"
                    @click="darkMode()"
            >
                <x-heroicon-o-moon class="w-5 h-5" ::class="theme === 'dark' ? 'hidden' : 'block'"/>
                <x-heroicon-s-moon class="w-5 h-5" ::class="theme === 'dark' ? 'block' : 'hidden'"/>
                {{ __('Dark') }}
            </button>
            <button class="flex w-full items-center gap-3 px-3 py-2 text-start text-sm leading-5 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 focus:outline-none focus:bg-gray-100 dark:focus:bg-gray-800 transition duration-150 ease-in-out"
                    :class="theme === undefined ? 'text-gray-900 font-medium dark:text-gray-100 dark:font-medium' : 'text-gray-700 font-normal dark:text-gray-400 dark:font-normal'"
                    @click="systemMode()"
            >
                <x-heroicon-o-computer-desktop class="w-5 h-5" ::class="theme === undefined ? 'hidden' : 'block'"/>
                <x-heroicon-s-computer-desktop class="w-5 h-5" ::class="theme === undefined  ? 'block' : 'hidden'"/>
                {{ __('System') }}
            </button>
        </x-slot>
    </x-dropdown>
</div>
```
This is what the switcher will look like:

![Screenshot of how the theme switcher appears on large screens](assets/img/theme-switcher-laravel-breeze-blade/theme-switcher-on-large-screen-light.png){: .light }
![Screenshot of how the theme switcher appears on large screens](assets/img/theme-switcher-laravel-breeze-blade/theme-switcher-on-large-screen-dark.png){: .dark }

Finally, let's add the switcher on small screens too. So in the *Responsive Navigation Menu* section but just before
the *Responsive Settings Options* section, add the following:
```html
<div class="py-3 px-4 border-t border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-600 grid grid-cols-3 gap-3 sm:hidden">
    <x-secondary-button @click="lightMode()" class="justify-center" ::class="theme === 'light' ? 'border-gray-400' : ''">
        <x-heroicon-o-sun class="w-5 h-5 mr-2" ::class="theme === 'light' ? 'hidden' : 'block'"/>
        <x-heroicon-s-sun class="w-5 h-5 mr-2" ::class="theme === 'light' ? 'block' : 'hidden'"/>
        {{ __('Light') }}
    </x-secondary-button>
    <x-secondary-button @click="darkMode()" class="justify-center" ::class="theme === 'dark' ? 'dark:border-white' : ''">
        <x-heroicon-o-moon class="w-5 h-5 mr-2" ::class="theme === 'dark' ? 'hidden' : 'block'"/>
        <x-heroicon-s-moon class="w-5 h-5 mr-2" ::class="theme === 'dark' ? 'block' : 'hidden'"/>
        {{ __('Dark') }}
    </x-secondary-button>
    <x-secondary-button @click="systemMode()" class="justify-center" ::class="theme === undefined ? 'border-gray-400 dark:border-white' : ''">
        <x-heroicon-o-computer-desktop class="w-5 h-5 mr-2" ::class="theme === undefined ? 'hidden' : 'block'"/>
        <x-heroicon-s-computer-desktop class="w-5 h-5 mr-2" ::class="theme === undefined ? 'block' : 'hidden'"/>
        {{ __('System') }}
    </x-secondary-button>
</div>
```
 And this is what it will look like:

![Screenshot of how the theme switcher appears on small screens](assets/img/theme-switcher-laravel-breeze-blade/theme-switcher-on-small-screen-light.png){: .light }
![Screenshot of how the theme switcher appears on small screens](assets/img/theme-switcher-laravel-breeze-blade/theme-switcher-on-small-screen-dark.png){: .dark }
