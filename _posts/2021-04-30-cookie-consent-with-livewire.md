In this article I will show how to build a Livewire component to ask for consent to store cookies.

While helping a friend rebuild their website, one of the requirement was to allow users to "like" a post. They could
like a post only once, of course, so I have to store that information somewhere. We don't have logged-in users, so I
had to use cookies for that. And with cookies comes the task of asking for the user's consent.

My starting point was the [cookie-consent](https://github.com/jorgbservices/cookie-consent) package. It was a good
starting point but there are a few issues with that, at least for my case:

- the text in the modals are pretty useless, so you are forced to publish the views and customise them.
- since you are changing the views, there is no point having config variables to choose whether to show the cookie
and/or privacy modal. Just add them or remove them as you please.
- most importantly, there is no way to store the fact that the user did not give their consent.

The last point was crucial for me, and that was why I decided to write my own component.

The idea is simple: if the user has never been asked, the show a modal to ask for consent. The modal will allow the user
to either give or refuse their consent. There is also a link to show the cookie policy, which in my case will be
another modal.

So, the first thing I needed was a service to tell me the status of the cookie.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Services;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cookie;

class CookieConsent
{
    public function cookieExists(): bool
    {
        return !is_null($this->getCookie());
    }

    public function consentHasBeenGiven(): bool
    {
        if ($this->getCookie() === $this->getConsentValue()) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }

    public function giveConsent(): void
    {
        Cookie::queue(
            config('cookie-consent.cookie_name'),
            config('cookie-consent.consent_value'),
            config('cookie-consent.consent_cookie_lifetime')
        );
    }

    public function refuseConsent(): void
    {
        Cookie::queue(
            config('cookie-consent.cookie_name'),
            config('cookie-consent.refuse_value'),
            config('cookie-consent.refuse_cookie_lifetime')
        );
    }

    /**
     * @return array|string|null
     */
    private function getCookie()
    {
        return request()->cookie(config('cookie-consent.cookie_name'));
    }

    private function getConsentValue(): string
    {
        return config('cookie-consent.consent_value');
    }
}
```
{: file="app/Services/CookieConsent.php" }

As you can see, it's pretty straightforward. We use some configuration which will see later, although they are quite
self-explanatory.

The bit that caught me of guard, and made me spend a couple of hours wondering why it did not work, was using the
`cookie()` helper rather than the `Cookie` facade. I just had to read the Laravel documentation to understand my error,
so please don't do the same.

Then I created the Livewire component

```bash
php artisan livewire:make CookieConsent
```

and put the following in its controller

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Livewire;

use Livewire\Component;

class CookieConsent extends Component
{
    public bool $askForConsent;

    public bool $openConsentModal;
    public bool $openCookieModal = false;

    public function mount(\App\Services\CookieConsent $service)
    {
        $this->askForConsent = !$service->cookieExists();
        $this->openConsentModal = true;
    }

    public function toggleCookieModal()
    {
        $this->openCookieModal = !$this->openCookieModal;
        $this->openConsentModal = !$this->openConsentModal;
    }

    public function giveConsent(\App\Services\CookieConsent $service)
    {
        $service->giveConsent();

        $this->openConsentModal = false;
        $this->askForConsent = false;
    }

    public function refuseConsent(\App\Services\CookieConsent $service)
    {
        $service->refuseConsent();

        $this->openConsentModal = false;
        $this->askForConsent = false;
    }

    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.cookie-consent.cookie-consent');
    }
}
```
{: file="app/Http/livewire/CookieConsent.php" }

Now, for the view, since I will have two modals, I decided to create two more views for those models. So, the main view
for the component, `resources/views/livewire/cookie-consent/cookie-consent.blade.php`{: .filepath }, will just include the other two:

```php
<div>
    @if($askForConsent)
        @include('livewire.cookie-consent.consent-modal')
        @include('livewire.cookie-consent.cookie-policy-modal')
    @endif
</div>
```
{: file="resources/views/livewire/cookie-consent/cookie-consent.blade.php" }

The main modal, `resources/views/livewire/cookie-consent/consent-modal.blade.php`{: .filepath }  is

```php
<div x-data="{ open: @entangle('openConsentModal') }" x-show="open"
     class="fixed z-10 w-full h-full top-0 left-0 flex items-center justify-center">

{: file="resources/views/livewire/cookie-consent/cookie-policy-modal.blade.php" }

I am sure you have noticed I used [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), which I highly recommend.

The text in all the models can be changed for whatever you need. All modals are fully responsive.

Now we come to the configuration. Create the `config/cookie-consent.php`{: .filepath } file and add the following:

```php
<?php

return [
    'cookie_name' => 'cookie_consent',

    'consent_value' => 'yes',
    'refuse_value' => 'no',

    'consent_cookie_lifetime' => 60 * 24 * 365,
    'refuse_cookie_lifetime' => 60 * 24 * 30,
];
```
{: file="config/cookie-consent.php" }

I strongly recommend changing the name of the cookie to make it unique to your site. You can also adjust the values and
lifetimes.

Finally, just add the new component to the pages you need it to, most likely all of them so add it to your layout.

And that's it. Now you can use the `CookieConsent` service around your code to check if the user has or has not given
consent to store cookies.

The code is also available as a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/troccoli/d7329605f0354d1c43f976ca1e477bfd).
